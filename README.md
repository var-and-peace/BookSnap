# BookSnaps

BookSnaps is a virtual bookshelf for your entire library!

## Description

BookSnaps is a mobile app built on React Native with the goal of being a central location for information about every book you own - whether it's a physical book, an e-book, or audio book. Currently users can search for books to add and even take a picture of their bookshelf to recieve a list of books to add to their library! 

BookSnaps utilizes React Native, RealmJS, Victory Native, and OpenCV-Python (among other technologies) to intelligently detect the edges of books, read text along the spines, and return a list of books (with information provided by Google Books API) for the user to choose what will be added to the library and provide a quick overview of information about your books.

BookSnaps aims to one day be able to consolidate your entire library, providing an easy way to keep track of everything you could want to know about the books you own.
